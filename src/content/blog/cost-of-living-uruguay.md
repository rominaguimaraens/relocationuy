Numbers are only useful when they reflect how people actually live. 

This guide runs through the budgets we see most often for singles, couples, and families settling into Montevideo's most popular expat neighborhoods — Pocitos, Punta Carretas, Buceo, Malvín, and Carrasco.

We'll talk through common surprises like **gastos comunes** on apartments, seasonal electricity spikes, prepaid health plans, and the price of a weekly produce haul at the feria. Consider it a local friend walking you through their spreadsheets so you can arrive with honest expectations — not the polished version you see in travel blogs.

## **Housing: What You'll Actually Pay**

### **Rent (Unfurnished Apartments)**

Most expats rent in these neighborhoods because they have good infrastructure, safety, beach access, and English-speaking resources:

**Pocitos:**
- 1-bedroom: $700-1,000/month
- 2-bedroom: $1,000-1,400/month
- 3-bedroom: $1,400-1,800/month

**Punta Carretas:**
- 1-bedroom: $800-1,200/month
- 2-bedroom: $1,200-1,600/month
- 3-bedroom: $1,600-2,200/month

**Buceo:**
- 1-bedroom: $600-900/month
- 2-bedroom: $900-1,200/month
- 3-bedroom: $1,200-1,600/month

**Malvín:**
- 1-bedroom: $600-850/month
- 2-bedroom: $850-1,150/month
- 3-bedroom: $1,150-1,500/month

**Carrasco:**
- 1-bedroom: $900-1,300/month
- 2-bedroom: $1,300-1,800/month
- 3-bedroom: $1,800-2,500/month

*Furnished apartments typically run 20-30% higher.*

### **Gastos Comunes (The Surprise Fee Nobody Warns You About)**

If you rent in a building with amenities (doorman, elevator, gym, pool), you'll pay **gastos comunes** — the monthly building maintenance fee.

**What it covers:** Building staff salaries, elevator maintenance, common area cleaning, water for shared spaces, sometimes gas for hot water.

**How much:** $80-250/month depending on the building

**The catch:** Landlords don't always mention this upfront. Always ask "¿Cuánto son los gastos comunes?" before signing a lease.

### **Security Deposits**

Expect to pay:
- **1-2 months' rent as deposit** (refundable)
- **1 month rent upfront** (first month)
- **Garantía (guarantee):** Some landlords require a garantía — either a property guarantee from a third party or a bank guarantee (around $500-800 one-time fee through companies like Contaduría)

**Total upfront cost to move in:** 2-3 months' rent equivalent

---

## **Utilities: The Real Numbers**

### **Electricity (UTE)**

**Summer (December-March):** $40-80/month for a 2-bedroom (AC usage drives this up)
**Winter (June-September):** $80-150/month for a 2-bedroom (electric heating is expensive)
**Spring/Fall:** $30-60/month

**Pro tip:** If you use electric heating in winter, your bill WILL spike. Many locals use gas heaters or layer up instead.

### **Water (OSE)**

$15-30/month (very affordable, sometimes included in gastos comunes)

### **Gas (For cooking/hot water)**

$20-40/month if your building uses supergas bottles
Some buildings have central gas (included in gastos comunes)

### **Internet**

$30-60/month for fiber (Antel, Movistar, Claro)
Speeds are good (100-300 Mbps), reliability is solid in most areas

### **Phone/Mobile**

Prepaid: $10-20/month
Postpaid plans: $25-50/month (unlimited calls/texts + data)

**Total monthly utilities for a couple in a 2-bedroom:** $150-300 (depending on season and usage)

## **Healthcare: Not Free, But Shockingly Affordable**

Uruguay has excellent healthcare — both public (free but slower) and private (affordable and fast). Most expats choose private.

### **Private Health Insurance (Mutualista Plans)**

**Coverage:** Doctor visits, specialists, prescriptions, hospital stays, emergency care

**Monthly cost:**
- Individual (under 40): $80-120/month
- Individual (40-60): $120-180/month
- Couple: $180-280/month
- Family (2 adults + 2 kids): $300-450/month

**Popular providers:** Médica Uruguaya, Casmu, Círculo Católico, Blue Cross, British Hospital

**What you pay at appointments:**
- General doctor: $0-5 co-pay
- Specialist: $5-15 co-pay
- Prescriptions: $2-20 depending on medication
- Emergency room: $0-30

**The catch:** Pre-existing conditions may have waiting periods (3-12 months before coverage kicks in)

## **The Surprises (What Catches People Off-Guard)**

### **1. Gastos Comunes**
Nobody tells you about this. Budget for it.

### **2. Winter Electricity Bills**
Electric heating is expensive. Your bill can triple in winter if you're not careful.

### **3. Imported Goods Are Pricey**
If you need specific American products (ranch dressing, Skippy peanut butter, Kraft mac & cheese), expect to pay 2-3x what you'd pay in the US — or just adjust to local brands.

### **4. Furniture Isn't Cheap**
If you rent unfurnished, expect to spend $2,000-5,000 furnishing an apartment from scratch (Ikea doesn't exist here).

### **5. Cash Is Still King**
Many small businesses (ferias, corner stores, some restaurants) prefer cash. Keep pesos on hand.

## **Is Uruguay Cheaper Than the US?**

**Yes, if you:**
- Cook at home mostly
- Use public transit
- Skip imported goods
- Live in Buceo/Malvín instead of Punta Carretas/Carrasco

**No, if you:**
- Eat out frequently
- Buy imported products
- Live in luxury buildings
- Send kids to private international schools

**Compared to major US cities (NYC, SF, LA, Seattle, Boston):** Uruguay is MUCH cheaper

**Compared to mid-size US cities (Nashville, Raleigh, Austin):** Uruguay is slightly cheaper or comparable

**Compared to small-town USA:** Uruguay might feel similar or slightly more expensive

## **Final Thoughts**

The cost of living in Uruguay is **very reasonable for the quality of life you get** — especially if you're coming from a major US city.

You're paying for:
- Political stability
- Universal healthcare
- Safety
- Beach access
- A slower, more humane pace of life

And honestly? That trade-off is worth it for most people.
