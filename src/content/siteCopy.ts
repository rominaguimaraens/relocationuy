Whether you're fleeing, exploring, or just ready for something new — you deserve support that feels human, not transactional.`,

    whyTitle: 'Why work with Uruguay Relocation Companion?',
    whyBody: `**Because we're not just processing your paperwork — we're actually *with* you.**

Most relocation services send you a checklist and wish you luck.  
**We show up.**  
We go to your appointments.  
We translate in real-time so you understand what's being asked.  
We walk you through neighborhoods and tell you which caf?s have the best medialunas and which streets feel safest at night.

---

### ??? We're bilingual locals who speak *your* language

Fluent in English and Spanish, we translate not just words but culture ?  
the unspoken rules, the neighborhood personalities, and the  
*?why does it work this way??* questions Google will never answer.

---

### ?? We're born-and-raised Montevideanos with deep roots here

We're not expats who moved here recently.  
We grew up here.  
We know every shortcut, every government office quirk, every  
?this is how it actually works? insider detail.

---

### ?? We treat you like a person, not a transaction

You're not Client #247.  
You're someone making one of the biggest decisions of your life.  
We don't rush you. We don?t judge you.  
**We just help.**`,
