Curious what it really costs to live in Montevideo? Here are the ranges we see for clients and friends who settle in popular neighborhoods like Pocitos, Punta Carretas, and Buceo.

## Monthly ballpark (USD)

- Rent: $800–$1,400 for a 1-2 bedroom in central neighborhoods
- Utilities + internet: $120–$170 depending on season and usage
- Groceries + eating out: $300–$600 based on your habits

## Local tips

- Rentals often list prices in USD — factor in building expenses (gastos comunes) before you sign.
- Winter electricity bills can spike; budget a little extra June–August.
- Markets and ferias keep produce costs down, and local apps make delivery easy once you arrive.
