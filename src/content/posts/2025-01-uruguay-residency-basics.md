Thinking about applying for residency in Uruguay? This guide walks you through the essentials so you know what to expect before you start paperwork or book your first appointment.

## What residency actually involves

- Understanding the DNM process and timelines
- Knowing which documents must be apostilled before you arrive
- Scheduling your health card and ID in the right order

## Our local take

Residency here is doable and predictable once you know the steps, but it helps to have someone bilingual to check your documents, book appointments, and translate in real time so nothing gets lost. If you want a calm, clear experience, start with organized documents and realistic timing — and ask for help when you need it.
