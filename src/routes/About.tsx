Romi quickly and efficiently identified solutions and without hesitation took action to ensure my wife‚Äôs health was a priority.  She not only facilitated a local doctor visit for us but came with us to see that office visit and subsequent medication pickup at a local pharmacy went smoothly. Her ability to anticipate things that we needed and work behind the scenes coordinating her local contacts and using her extensive knowledge of the Uruguayan  practices was comforting and reassuring. We knew we were being taken care of. When we do come back to Uruguay, Romi will be the first one we contact to coordinate our return.  Thank you again for all that you did for us.",

                Moving to Uruguay can be exciting ‚Äî the fresh start, the slower pace, the ocean breeze, the mate in the mornings. But we also know that figuring out the practical side ‚Äî residency, translations, DNM appointments, where to go, who to ask ‚Äî can feel like a maze when you‚Äôre new here.
              </p>
              <p>That‚Äôs exactly why we started Uruguay Relocation Companion.</p>
              <p>
                We‚Äôre Romina and Tomas, two locals who‚Äôve spent years helping newcomers find their footing here in Uruguay. What began as simply helping friends with paperwork and appointments turned into something bigger ‚Äî a full relocation support service built around real human connection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our goal is to take the stress and confusion out of the process, so you can focus on enjoying your new life instead of getting lost in bureaucracy. We‚Äôll help you with all the essentials ‚Äî from your residency application and carn√© de salud to opening a bank account, setting up a SIM card, or finding a long-term rental.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything we do is bilingual (English + Spanish) and personalized to your situation ‚Äî no cookie-cutter packages, no cold legal language. Just honest, caring guidance from people who live here and know how things really work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether you‚Äôre moving alone, as a couple, or with family (and pets!), we‚Äôre here to make sure you always feel supported, understood, and at home.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because relocation isn‚Äôt just about paperwork ‚Äî it‚Äôs about people, comfort, and feeling that you truly belong üåø

                <p>Hi! I‚Äôm Romina, one of the co-founders of Uruguay Relocation Companion.</p>
                <p>
                  I was born and raised in Uruguay, and over the years I‚Äôve met many people who came here hoping to build a new chapter of their lives ‚Äî often full of excitement, but also a bit overwhelmed by the process. Seeing that inspired me to start helping others make their move easier and less stressful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I began by assisting foreign friends with their residency paperwork, appointments, and translations ‚Äî and quickly realized how much of a difference it makes to have someone local who can explain things clearly, go along to in-person visits, and handle the little details that make life smoother here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I‚Äôm fluent in English and Spanish, detail-oriented, and genuinely enjoy helping people feel cared for, informed, and supported as they settle into their new life in Uruguay. My approach is calm, organized, and personal ‚Äî because moving to a new country should feel like a fresh start, not a mountain of paperwork.

                <p>Hello my name is Tomas.</p>
                <p>
                  I‚Äôm an Uruguayan who at the age of 19 moved to the US. Throughout my 6 years in the US I was able to make friends, integrate, find employment, and ultimately become a citizen.

                <p>
                  I have first hand experience of the immigration process, and I understand what a daunting experience it can be. It‚Äôs full of surprises and challenges, but with the right support it can be the best experience of your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With my help I can assure your integration into Uruguay will be as smooth as possible.
